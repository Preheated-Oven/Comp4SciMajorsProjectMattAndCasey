#This is a document detailing the progress being made on the computing project for Matthew Anderson and Casey Cox. Our project involves writing a program that can detect the timing intervals of an adjusatble timing circuit.This project will utilize the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi and will be written using Python. 

#The first github repository used will be gpiozero, found at https://github.com/gpiozero/gpiozero 

#The timing circuit used is a digital LED relay board timing circuit found at https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Timing-Circuit-Switch-Trigger/dp/B074TBRRTY/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=timing+circuit&qid=1617815030&sr=8-3
#My initial plan will be to use the included button function. When the button is pressed, it will set the voltage to high. The program will then start a timer. The timer will stop when the voltage is set to low. The result will then be printed.

#Example code
```{python}
from gpiozero import Button
from signal import pause
from time import time
#These are the definitions that will be used in this code. "Button" is a function that will detect when the timing circuit opens and closes the circuit. "time" will refer to the time ellapsed between intervals. In this case, the opening and closing of the circuit.

def time_start():
    time()
def time_end():
    time()
button = Button(2)
#These definitions will be used below to measure intervals of time between the circuit opening and closing.

button.when_pressed = time_start
button.when_released = time_end
#This code will read the intervals between the circuit opening and closing and return the time ellapsed with the "print" command bellow.

print['time_start'-'time_end']

pause()
```
